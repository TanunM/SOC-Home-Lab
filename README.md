# SOC-Home-Lab

## Introduction
This document provides a guide for setting up a Security Operations Center (SOC) home lab. The lab consists of two virtual machines (VMs): an attacker machine running Kali Linux and a victim machine running Windows 10. The primary objective of this lab is to simulate real-world security scenarios, analyze attacks, and enhance practical cybersecurity skills.

## Objective
The objective of this lab is to:  
- Simulate cyber attacks in a controlled environment.  
- Monitor and analyze system and network logs using SIEM tools.  
- Gain hands-on experience with Sysmon, Splunk, and Windows Event Logs.  
- Understand attack techniques and learn defensive strategies.  
- Develop practical cybersecurity skills applicable to a SOC analyst role.
